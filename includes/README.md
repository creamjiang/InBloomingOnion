Description of Includes
======

Building description and instructions for new included files.

Included files will be a lot like modules or extensions.  Here are my thoughts:
* name.mod.php is a module or class implementation
* name.inbloom.class.php is an extension or implementation of a class file
* name.ext.php is an extension such as JavaScript

These things will probably change.
