InBloomingOnion
=============

The InBloomingOnion is a 'peeling' back of the data presented from InBloom for drilldown purposes.  There is obviously a lot of work to be done on this project and I will accept help wherever one wants to offer.  The project was originally forked from slc-classview-php (see contributions) written by Jason Hoekstra and worked on from that point.  Further work and progress is leading to a PHP Class developed for InBloom that should be interchangable between other APIs that are used to access SIS data.

Desired Features
------
* Single Sign On Capabilities and Authentication: Provide a SAML login for access with different SSO solutions including Shibboleth
* Roles and Permissions: Assign roles and permissions for administrators, teachers, parents and students
* Dynamic Blocks: Take from Drupal Blocks and add in 'modules' for disecting information from InBloom
* Module Approach: Create a modular approach for enabling and disabling modules that draw from the API

Thanks and Contributions
=============
The original template used for this project can be found at https://github.com/jasonhoekstra/slc-classview-php and was written by Jason Hoekstra.  I want to first and foremost thank him for writing a great template for me to work around and putting it on GitHub in the first place!

I would also like to thank David Knox and Mary Ann Powell for their ideas and feedback on the project!

Finally I would like to thank the InBloom project and their dev camp for making the time and information available to create and work on the project in the first place!

Thank you to you all - Jason Cameron
